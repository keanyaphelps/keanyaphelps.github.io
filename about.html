    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm a Technical Project Manager with a passion for helping development teams deliver great software. I come from a non-traditional background and transitioned into tech through coding bootcamps, open-source contribution, and hands-on mentorship.</p>
    <p>My favorite work involves coordinating across disciplines to solve real-world problems, especially in the civic tech and nonprofit space. Outside of work, I love house music, dancing, and organizing community events.</p>
