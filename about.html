    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Here’s a bit about me: At heart, I’m a problem-solver, but by trade, I’m a software developer and project manager based in Chicago, IL. My journey into tech kicked off with a coding bootcamp during the pandemic, but before that adventure, I spent many years in account management. I began my tech career as a developer, but I soon discovered my true passion lies in project management—a role that lets me combine my problem-solving skills with my love for collaboration. My years in account management taught me how to build strong client relationships, while my hands-on experience as a developer helps me bridge the gap between technical teams and stakeholders. I’ve earned my CAPM certification, and I’m currently preparing for the PMP exam to continue leveling up my skills. As I look ahead, I’m excited to keep refining my expertise and tackling new challenges in this dynamic, ever-evolving field!.</p>
    <p>My favorite work involves coordinating across disciplines to solve real-world problems. Outside of work, I love house music, dancing, and organizing community events.</p>
